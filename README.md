# Bone Fracture Classifier

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bone Fracture Classifier** is a machine learning-based model designed to detect bone fractures from medical images. It utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze X-ray images and classify them as fractured or non-fractured.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Automated Fracture Detection**: Uses deep learning to classify bone fractures.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes image normalization and augmentation techniques.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implements CNN-based architectures for classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for experimentation and visualization

## 📂 Files
- `Bone_Fracture_Classifier.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing code for dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🔧 Setup & Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Bone_Fracture_Classifier.ipynb
   ```
3. **Train the Model**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
